2,"-Breakout room ""too"" instead of 2
-small recurring problems with audio recording (not sure if it already runs, accidently stop in recording early) -> quickly resolved",,- sushi restaurant: a little unsure about follow-up question
3,"Some problems with the microphone: Sometimes does not record., speech recognition sometimes recognises words incorrectly.",,
1,long loading times at the beginning,sometimes does not sound very human like,a bit unsure how to answer the first questions about the restaurant
4,- Sometimes the time it takes to produce an answer is unexpectedly long. But it is not really off putting. ,,"- Respondent was put off by highest scale of 7 when determining ""level of interest in politics"". Respondent considered highest value of 10 more intuitive. 
- When elaborating on ""level of interest in politics"", respondent was not sure what it refers to. Wished AI to be more clear. Sentence structure not intuitive "
9,The recording was not possible,,some questions need to be more clear
7,"- run time is quite slow, it takes a couple (>5 seconds)

- voice recording does not get all spoken words in the sentence

-  voice recoding also takes in the wrong word e.g. ai spoken --> aA recorded

- the recording button didnt work good. stopped randomly mid sentence and had to be clicked quite often before finally starting to record

- on the last questions the recordings lagged a couple seconds

- answer time also decreased further","- recording just stopped completely for a couple seconds and interviewee was kinda mad about it. bad ai system or  cheap ass servers

- voice recoding suddenly capitalized letters

",just irritated by the voice recording function  
5,"Dictation did not work, ","The AI seems not to be neutral. It emphasises on the given answers and even adds points to the argument.
",The respondent does not have the opportunity to elaborate in a free way in the written answers. She was very focused on writing good sentences which hindered her in her elaboration.
8,"Audio recording is a problem, sometimes respondent can not give answers with using audio, sometimes there are spelling mistakes.","no, this did not appear.","After answering questions, time costs too long when interviewer summarizes respondentÂ´s opinons."
