# Coding Guidelines: Response Quality

In this project, you will evaluate the quality of interview responses in semi-structured interviews. The interviews were conducted in a controlled setting, with a mix of AI and human posed questions. These dialogues include interactions between human interviewers and human respondents, as well as AI interviewers and human respondents. Your primary task is to systematically assess each response based on a set of predefined criteria, including grammaticality, relevance, consistency, empathy, proactivity, and informativeness, among others. You will use these criteria to rate the responses.

## TL;DR

**Each interview response should be annotated individually.**

- Make sure to read the entire response before starting the annotation.
- Use the provided coding scheme and definitions for consistency.
- If you encounter any difficulties or ambiguities, please write us a message.

**Note:** Importantly, whenever you notice odd, unexpected, inappropriate respondent behavior that is not captured by the guidelines, record this behavior with a brief text comment in the "Comment" column.

## Scales and Confidence Score

**Each response should be evaluated on the following criteria using a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = Poor, 5 = Excellent). Please also indicate your confidence with a confidence score using a scale of 1 to 5**. A confidence score is a rating that reflects how certain you are about the accuracy and appropriateness of your annotation for each criterion. It indicates your level of confidence that your assessment is correct based on the given data and your understanding of the criteria.

- 1: Not Confident: Highly uncertain, found the response difficult to interpret or apply criteria to, with multiple plausible interpretations.
- 2: Slightly Confident: Somewhat uncertain, parts of the response were challenging to evaluate, with some ambiguities present.
- 3: Moderately Confident: Reasonably certain, response generally clear with minor uncertainties, likely correct with some doubt.
- 4: Confident: Quite certain, response clear and criteria easy to apply, with few to no ambiguities.
- 5: Very Confident: Highly certain, response very clear and straightforward to evaluate, with no doubts.

## Criteria

### Grammaticality

*Evaluate the correctness of the grammar used in the response. Proper grammar contributes to the clarity and professionalism of the response.*

1. Multiple grammatical errors that hinder understanding.
2. Frequent grammatical errors.
3. Some grammatical errors, but they do not significantly hinder understanding.
4. Few grammatical errors.
5. No grammatical errors; completely correct.

### Relevance

*Assess how closely the response pertains to the topic or question asked. Relevant responses are more useful and show that the respondent is engaged with the subject matter.*

1. Response is completely off-topic.
2. Response is mostly off-topic.
3. Response is somewhat relevant but includes off-topic information.
4. Response is mostly relevant to the topic.
5. Response is completely relevant to the topic.

### Specificity

*Evaluate how specific and detailed the response is in addressing the question or topic.*

1. Very vague, with no specific details.
2. Mostly vague, with few specific details.
3. Somewhat specific, with some detailed information.
4. Mostly specific, with substantial detailed information.
5. Very specific, with comprehensive and detailed information.

### Clarity

*Evaluate the clarity of the response in conveying the intended message.*

1. Very unclear; difficult to understand.
2. Mostly unclear; somewhat difficult to understand.
3. Somewhat clear; moderately easy to understand.
4. Mostly clear; easy to understand.
5. Very clear; very easy to understand.

### Empathy

*Measure the degree to which the response shows understanding and sensitivity towards the interviewer or the context. Empathy indicates a more human-like and considerate interaction.*

1. No empathetic expressions; cold and impersonal.
2. Rare empathetic expressions; mostly impersonal.
3. Some empathetic expressions; occasionally personal.
4. Frequent empathetic expressions; mostly personal.
5. Consistently empathetic and personal throughout.

### Response Complexity

*Evaluate the complexity of the response.*

1. Very easy to read; short sentences and basic vocabulary.
2. Easy to read; primarily short sentences with simple vocabulary.
3. Somewhat easy to read; a mix of short and long sentences, moderate vocabulary.
4. Somewhat difficult to read; longer sentences and advanced vocabulary.
5. Very difficult to read; very long sentences and highly advanced vocabulary.

### Engagement

*Assess the level of engagement and enthusiasm shown in the response.*

1. Completely disengaged; no enthusiasm or interest shown.
2. Mostly disengaged; little enthusiasm or interest shown.
3. Somewhat engaged; moderate enthusiasm or interest shown.
4. Mostly engaged; significant enthusiasm or interest shown.
5. Very engaged; high level of enthusiasm or interest shown.

### Tone

*Assess the appropriateness and consistency of the tone used in the response.*

1. Inappropriate tone; inconsistent and unsuitable for the context.
2. Mostly inappropriate tone; somewhat inconsistent and unsuitable.
3. Neutral tone; neither highly appropriate nor inappropriate.
4. Mostly appropriate tone; consistent and suitable for the context.
5. Very appropriate tone; highly consistent and suitable for the context.
