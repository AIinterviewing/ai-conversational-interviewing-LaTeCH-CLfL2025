Let’s start. Please note that there are no right or wrong answers. We are just interested in your views.

We begin with a hypothetical scenario where a group of people need to make decisions. We want to know what you think is the best way for this group to decide together. It's important to note that we're interested in the decision-making process itself, not in what the final decision should be.

Imagine a group of 10 people are deciding where to have a dinner event. Seven people want to have the event at a Japanese sushi restaurant. Three people cannot eat sushi because they have fish allergies and they want to have the event at an Italian restaurant instead. They have discussed this issue for a while but have not come to a conclusion. How should the group decide what to do?",2024-03-28 14:34:07

This way, everyone can participate without health risks and hopefully enjoy the dinner event together.

Random selection can be quick and impartial, ensuring that no particular preference dominates by chance, but it might not satisfy everyone's needs or preferences. On the other hand, choosing a completely different activity could avoid the controversy altogether, potentially finding common ground that pleases the whole group, though it diverts from the original plan of dining out.
