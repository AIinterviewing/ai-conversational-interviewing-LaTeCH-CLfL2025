Role,Timestamp,TextInterviewer,00:00:02,"Okay. So before we start with the questions on society and politics, please tell us the number of your breakout room that you're currently in."Respondent,00:00:12,"My breakout room is 9"Interviewer,00:00:18,"Perfect. Okay, so let's start. Please note that, there are no right or wrong answers. We are just interested in your views. So we begin with a hypothetical scenario where a group of people."Interviewer,00:00:45,"Okay, so we begin with a hypothetical scenario where a group of people need to make decisions. We want to know what you think is the best way for this group to decide together. It's important to note that we're interested in the decision making process itself and not what the final decision should be. So imagine a group of ten people are deciding where to have a dinner event. Seven people want to have the event at a Japanese sushi restaurant, and three people cannot eat sushi because they have a fish allergy and they want to have the event at an Italian restaurant instead. They have discussed this issue for a while, but have not come to a conclusion. How should the group decide what to do?"Respondent,00:01:33,"I think, the person who preferred to eat sushi would be better to go to a Japanese restaurants. And the people who prefer to eat Italian food go to the Italian restaurants."Interviewer,00:01:49,"Okay. Perfect. Next question. Can you think of other ways to make a decision apart from the method you just described? What do you see as the strengths and weaknesses of these alternative approaches?"Respondent,00:02:03,"You mean about my answer? Yeah. I think, I think this is a more fair decision because nobody would be forced to go somewhere that he or she doesnt like to be. And that, mean freedom. People can go anywhere they like. I guess I answered the question or not?"Interviewer,00:02:30,"This is up to you really. But I think one part to note is that they have a dinner event. I think it assumes that they have to be there together. How would you answer the question if you would assume this option?"Respondent,00:02:48,"You mean we are not allowed to divide them to go to different restaurants?"Interviewer,00:02:52,"How I understood it. Maybe not."Respondent,00:02:58,"I think I cannot, answer this question clearly, because I cannot. I cannot, disregard the rights of three people that don't like the sushi. I'm not sure how to answer this question."Interviewer,00:03:13,"Okay."Respondent,00:03:14,"Yeah."Interviewer,00:03:16,"I just have to specify that they have fish allergies, so its not that they don't like it, it's just that they are allergic."Respondent,00:03:29,"I don't understand what you mean exactly."Interviewer,00:03:32,"I just want to clarify that you said that three people, they don't like sushi, but the problem is they have fish allergy, so they really cannot go there."Respondent,00:03:41,"Yeah. They can't, you know, they cannot eat sushi. So I cannot force them to eat, to come to join the set. People to come to sushi restaurant. So I cannot answer this question fairly because, I don't want to disregard the other the three people. Right. I don't know what kind of decision would be right, to that. It's a difficult, very difficult situation."Interviewer,00:04:05,"I don't think there is a right or wrong answer. Okay. So let's talk a bit about politics on a scale from one \-- not interested at all to seven \-- very interested. How interested are you in politics?"Respondent,00:04:23,"Four."Interviewer,00:04:24,"Okay. Yeah. Can you elaborate and explain your level of interest in politics?"Respondent,00:04:32,"To be honest, our life is dependent to politicians decisions. So, trying to understand politics and the politician decision is kind of help us to maybe to participate in society better because, politicians are controlling everything in our societies and awards. So being informed about a bit about politics, politicians can help us."Interviewer,00:05:04,"Okay. And what do you think politics is? How would you define the term?"Respondent,00:05:14,"Politics, I think, is a. Like a\... I don't know. Politics is like in a game. Maybe."Interviewer,00:05:27,"Okay. So think back to the last time you took part in an action that you considered political, whether it was a small or significant act. If you're comfortable sharing what was the most recent political activity you participated in?"Respondent,00:05:47,"I think, maybe around 8 or 9 years ago, I participated in a present presidential election in my country."Interviewer,00:06:10,"Okay. Perfect. Thank you for your answer. Okay. Consider a scenario where a seven year old boy decides to stop eating meat after watching a documentary on meat production. But his mother insists that he should continue to eat meat. Do you believe the situation raises a political issue within the family? Are they discussing politics?"Respondent,00:06:38,"Yeah. Yeah, it's the political, the political situations, because they should finally reach an agreement to what kind of activities they should do. They should listen to everybody, to all in a family. It's a political situation."Interviewer,00:06:58,"Okay. Perfect. Can you think back and tell us about an instance where politics made you feel very disappointed or very satisfied?"Respondent,00:07:10,Can you please repeat the question?Interviewer,00:07:19,"So, can you think back and tell us about an instance where politics made you feel very disappointed or very satisfied?"Respondent,00:07:33,"According to my society, where I came from, politics, was not satisfying for me because. As I remember, that kind of policies destroyed my life. Yeah, it depends on society, dispensary, geographical, environment and area. You live, you study at. I think for this kind of question you cannot as answer, for example, the person who live in Germany or USA, a person leaving Afghanistan or other cities or Syria may answer differently because they experience many different situations."Interviewer,00:08:14,"Could you tell us a specific example, maybe?"Respondent,00:08:18,"For example, for example, due to imposing sanctions by USA towards my country for maybe they say Islamic regime in Iran do some bad things, we have to impose sanctions and that sanctions destroy my society economically and forced me to immigrate to other countries."Interviewer,00:08:42,"Okay. Thank you. Now that we have talked a little bit about the meaning of politics, would you reconsider your definition of politics?"Respondent,00:08:54,"What is my definition of politics?"Interviewer,00:08:58,So after we talked about this. Do you maybe have another definition of politics now than you had five minutes ago?Respondent,00:09:09,"No. I think politics is like a game. Some people enjoying it, playing that game. Some people are not. So, for example, imagine a soccer player playing in a some some people are defender maybe with wishes. So some people are middle field, there are not that much care. You know, some people are trying, you know, it's treasure for some people for some for some countries and for some parties. And it's not that enjoyable for other societies and persons or communities. And it is like a game."Interviewer,00:09:47,"Okay. So next question. So let us talk about democracy. When you think about how democracy works right now in Western countries such as Germany. What are the good things that come to mind?"Respondent,00:10:07,"Democracy. To be honest, I don't have any specific, definition, for democracy and democracy is an ideal version, you cannot see democracy anywhere, it is as the idea of the ideal version. But compared to my country or other societies, Germany's political system is so nice and people have a lot of freedom, maybe a lot of opportunity to live better, but I'm not sure. How can I rate a democracy in Germany or in USA or in UK? I don't know, to be honest. Because, again, based on Jean-Jacques Rousseau and, you can not count the 20s and say, for example, this pen is better than other pen, instead in comparisons. So I cannot say anything about democracy in a specific society."Interviewer,00:11:03,"But do you have a good example about the democracy in Germany?"Respondent,00:11:13,"Yeah. I think, for example, in Germany you can see many different people with different kind of religion or culture and all living in peace together. And, here is freedom. Freedom in the economy, for example, freedom in, different, very different kind of classes. Or for example, I can say here, as a basic, basic example can I say is, people here can do everything they like and they wishes without hurting other other, other persons, or there's other parts of society, for example, you can go to mass events, a person can go to church, for example, person can drink wine or beer. Some don't want to drink wine. And people are allowed to do everything they like."Interviewer,00:12:03,"Okay. So and what are the bad things that come to mind about democracy in the West."Respondent,00:12:11,"Bad things about democracy. Yes. To be honest, I don't have any specific, you know, understanding, a very clear, understanding what is exactly democracy is. And here I have not seen any bad things. Politically or sociably. I cannot say anything about bad things because I don't have any specific understanding about because I'm not a politician. I don't know what democracy is, what is this foundation, what it is meaning. But here I have not seen any bad things."Interviewer,00:12:51,"Okay. Okay. So, generally speaking, what makes a country democratic, in your view? What are the most important elements of a democracy?"Respondent,00:13:10,"To be honest, to my understanding, democracy means allow people to continue their paths and far and follow their dreams regardless of their religion, their races, their nationality, languages, and to to provide equal opportunity for all people for a different kind of culture, society. Or for example, you know, in a real democracy means all persons, regardless to their beliefs, races should have equal opportunity to live in a good and high quality situation."Interviewer,00:14:01,"Okay. So the next question is the architects of Munich's Olympia Park for the 1972 Olympics aim to create a democratic landscape that is open and accessible to all. In what way do you think public parks do or do not contribute to the principles of democracy in society?"Respondent,00:14:28,"I don't know, to be honest, because I don't know what is the role of the park to the democracy of the society or the city. I think it's the open area and all people can go on enjoy. Without any problem. That's part of democracy."Interviewer,00:14:49,"Why do you think they built this landscape there? The Munich's Olympia Park for the 1972 Olympics."Respondent,00:15:03,"Why they did they create that? For Olympic Games because they need a lot of places to facilitate the Olympic."Interviewer,00:15:21,"I think it's more about the Munich's Olympia Park and that it's a democratic landscape. Yeah, but."Respondent,00:15:30,"If there's any idea. Because I went to Olympia Park but I have never thought about from this context. City Park is a full court, tennis court and is very, for example, lakes. Yeah."Interviewer,00:15:50,"Okay. Perfect. I think\..."Respondent,00:15:54,"Finish?"Interviewer,00:15:55,"Yeah. I think this is all."Respondent,00:15:57,"Okay."Respondent,00:15:58,"Thank you for your time."
