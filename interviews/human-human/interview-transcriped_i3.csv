Interviewer,00:00:00,"Okay, I guess we can start. So, questionnaire, in-depth interview about democracy. Question one: before we start with the questions on society and politics, please tell us the number of your breakout room that you're currently in."
Respondent,00:00:25,It is a room number 5
Interviewer,00:00:28,"Room number in question two. Let's start. Please note that there are no right or wrong answers. We are just interested in your views. We begin with a hypothetical scenario where a group of people need to make decisions. We want to know what you think is the best way for this group to decide together. It's important to note that we are interested in the decision making process itself, not in what the final decision should be. Imagine a group of ten people are deciding where to have a dinner event. Seven people want to have this event at a Japanese sushi restaurant. Three people cannot eat sushi because they have fish allergies, and they want to have the event at the Italian restaurant instead. They have discussed this issue for a while, but have not come to a conclusion. How should the group decide what to do?"
Respondent,00:01:39,"I think, on the first hand, I would have secured that majority wins, so that the people have to do what the majority said. But on the other hand, since the three people and, in my opinion, have a valid reason to not go the sushi restaurant, which is, that it's sort of like they don't like it, but it's just it's a reason not to go there. And they maybe should or their decision should also be counted. So it's not entirely a majority vote anymore. So, if I were them, I would explored on possibilities so everybody is satisfied. Maybe they could go to a place where both Japanese and Italian food work, or they can talk about what people want to eat, actually. Maybe they go to a restaurant with the food and also the other food. Yeah. I think, I think that if they do fair break, people, who cannot go, should be included in the decision making. There should be like a veto right of the minority group. And then, based on, based on that and, let's say, on the remaining restaurants properties they should make a decision."
Interviewer,00:03:33,Okay. Question three: Can you think of other ways to make decisions apart from the method you just described? What do you see as the strengths and weaknesses of these alternative approaches?
Respondent,00:03:52,"So there can obviously be just a majority vote. So, whichever decision the majority made. It's gonna win. And I already said the weakness would be that some people are going to be veto it because they might have reasons why they cannot go to the restaurant. So. Yeah. Or they will have no possibility to participate in the group. Maybe, another approach would be to then everybody makes the list and great from 0 to 10 for which restaurant he or she wants to go. And then all are added up and the restaurant which has the highest number of rating is the chosen restaurant. But at the same time, this also does not include, does exclude people who have reasons or very specific reasons why they don't want to go to the that specific place."
Interviewer,00:05:18,Okay. Great. Question number four. Let's talk a bit about politics on a scale from one \-- not interested at all \-- to seven \-- very interested. How interested are you in politics?
Respondent,00:05:36,I would say two.
Interviewer,00:05:39,Okay. Two. Question number five. Can you elaborate and explain your level of interest in politics?
Respondent,00:05:50,"So, I would say it's a two because I regularly follow the news. I'm very interested in the decisions that politicians make. And I'm also interested in the implication that the decisions of politicians have, for example, on the economy or the society. It's nevertheless, it's not a one since I don't spend all day on it, so that's okay."
Interviewer,00:06:27,Great. Question number five. Can you elaborate and explain your level of interest in politics? Okay. This we did. We just did. Sorry.
Respondent,00:06:39,Yeah.
Interviewer,00:06:40,Question number six. And what do you think politics is? How would you define this term?
Respondent,00:06:52,I would say politics. It is an institution. Or the creation of the book that gives power to a small group of society which decides how the society has to run after which rule or which rules and norms the society is going to be run.
Interviewer,00:07:46,Okay. You're ready. That's it?
Respondent,00:07:48,Yeah. That's it.
Interviewer,00:07:53,Okay. Question number seven. Think back to the last time you took part in an action that you considered political. Whether it was a small or significant act. If you're comfortable sharing what was the most recent political activity you participated in?
Respondent,00:08:28,"I would say it is the voting. So, I don't know which election it was in the last. Yeah, but it was definitely voting."
Interviewer,00:08:30,"And so voting is a political act? Definitely. Yeah. Question number eight. Consider a scenario where a seven year old boy decides to stop eating meat after watching a documentary on meat production, but his mother insists that he should continue to eat meat. Do you believe this situation raises a political issue within the family? Are they discussing politics?"
Respondent,00:09:04,"It depends on your definition of politics, I would say. So, based on the definition that I gave before, t would not be political. Obviously you can define politics in a different way. And then, this could also be a political discussion, saying someone who has power, who is the mother, insists or makes the rules on other people, in this case, the son, who is not in power. So, in part, it would also align with the explanation that I came with for politics. But we are not talking about our society and all the other things we just talked about"
Interviewer,00:10:12,Okay. Question 11. Let us talk about.
Respondent,00:10:19,We are in question nine. I guess.
Interviewer,00:10:25,"I am sorry, I am, I am, I just scrolled a bit."
Respondent,00:10:30,"Yeah, I am sorry."
Interviewer,00:10:31,Okay. Question nine: can you think back and tell us about an instance where politics made you feel very disappointed or very satisfied?
Respondent,00:10:48,"I'd pick one political decision that made me very satisfied. I think with the nine-euro ticket, which we had after the Covid pandemic which, in my opinion, was a very good decision that politicians made. A very disapointing political action is of course the war in Ukraine was a it was a very political, political, political action, that I would consider is very disappointing if you want to call it like that. And yeah of course it was political."
Interviewer,00:11:50,Okay. Next question. Question number ten. Now that we have talked a little about the meaning of politics. Would you reconsider your definition of politics?
Respondent,00:12:05,"Maybe I would broaden my definition. Not in so that it's not only in terms of vulnerable group in society ruling over the big group, but the. In any situation where there is people who rule over other people. So, big politics in that situation, but also put in companies and, you know, whatever, whatever, NGOs. Yeah. People, I don't know. Fridays for Future. They also do politics in a way. So yeah, I would broaden that, but still say that making decisions over our society, over our life."
Interviewer,00:13:16,So next question. Question number 11. Let us talk about democracy. When you think about how democracy works right now in Western countries such as Germany. What are the good things that come to mind?
Respondent,00:13:45,"So I think there's a good thing about democracy in Germany it's that every vote is really counted and then it's just counted once. So we have a really, that would be fair voting process, I would say. And people who are given power, I would say generally only do it or to only use their power for different and for the and benefit of a big group, so not like in other countries where the misuse the power in their area in general."
Interviewer,00:14:35,Okay. Good. Question number 12. What are the bad things that come to your mind about democracy in the West?
Respondent,00:14:47,"I would say bad things about democracy in the West are that democracy in general is going to be slower, that in a democracy everybody has to be heard, and every opinion has to be, it has to be heard and, thought throught. And that makes democracy itself very slow. And in certain situations democracy would be better if the person who is ruling is ruling in favor of the population, I would say."
Interviewer,00:15:28,"Okay. Question number 13. Generally speaking, what makes a country democratic in your view? What are the most important elements of democracy?"
Respondent,00:15:41,"So obviously there has to be a voting in some way or another. So, people have to decide who are they ruled by. And on the other hand, there has to be they have to be able to be elected. So, if there's only one person who you can vote for, it's obviously not a democracy. Although, some countries call it like that. I think also part of democracy is that minorities are also heard. So you shouldn't be able, even as a majority in the society, you shouldn't be able to overrule the minority in situations. So, yeah. And of course, basic human rights, which we have agreed on. In the West, freedom of speech, freedom of reunion."
Interviewer,00:17:04,"Great. Now, question number 14. The architect of Munich's Olympic Park for the 1972 Olympics aimed to create a democratic landscape that is open and accessible to all. In what way do you think public parks do or not, or do not contribute to the principles of democracy in society?"
Respondent,00:17:46,"Big parks like the Olympia are usually the spots where people are able to meet and then they can also do and have events, political events sometimes that will that obviously contribute to principle of democracy. So, the freedom to unite and freedom of speech. So, I would say they definitely contribute to democracy because it makes people able to unite, exchange thoughts and participate in democracy."
Interviewer,00:18:34,Okay. Great. So this is the end of our questionnaire and I stop the recording.
