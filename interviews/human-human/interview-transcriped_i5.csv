Interviewer,00:00:00,"Let's go, I started off."
Interviewer,00:00:06,"Hello, Robin"
Respondent,00:00:08,"Hey."
Interviewer,00:00:10,"Before we start with the questions on society and politics, please tell us the number of your breakout room that you are currently in."
Respondent,00:00:17,"Four"
Interviewer,00:00:19,"Nice. Let's start. Please note that there are no right or wrong answers. We are just interested in your views. We begin with a hypothetical, hypothetical scenario where a group of people need to make decisions. You should promote what you think is the best way for this group to decide together. It's important to note that we are interested in the decision making process itself, not the final decision. So imagine, imagine a group of ten people or deciding where to have a dinner event. Seven people want to have ended dinner at the event at a Japanese sushi restaurant, three people cannot eat sushi because they have fish allergies, and they want to have the event at an Italian restaurant instead. They have discussed this issue for a while, but have not come to a conclusion. How should the group decide what to do?"
Respondent,00:01:29,"Sorry. So this is basically the question you ask in the AI part, right?"
Interviewer,00:01:36,"Yes. Same question. So, there are several people who wants to eat sushi, then Japanese restaurant and, the other ones want to eat Italian restaurant instead because they have fish allergy. What do you suggest?"
Respondent,00:01:53,"Got it. So I suppose it depends on if you would ask the seven people how you would, how they would rank Italian food compared to the sushi part. And if they don't really care too much about it, they obviously can just go to the Italian restaurant. But also if people have allergies, it's also a good reason to in general, I guess, take the italian thing. It's a good reason. And the on the other hand, sushi doesn't really require fish, so I don't see any reason why they also could not just go eating sushi and eat cucumber or something. It's a weird question that I don't really know how to answer. I guess a democratic decision would then go to the sushi place."
Interviewer,00:02:31,"So you are intimidating to sushi and fish that live on sea. And, you are saying something in favor of the seven people who wants to eat in the japanese restaurants. It's a final decision. Nice. Can you think of other ways to make decisions apart from the method we just described? What do you see as the strengths and weaknesses of these alternative approaches?"
Respondent,00:03:04,"If so, could I think of an alternative? Okay. If this is the idea that the majority decides democraticly, what to do then obviously an altertative is just do what the other three supposed or wanted to eat and\... And what am I supposed to say? Like the upsides of the alternatives?"
Interviewer,00:03:32,"Yes. Strengths and weaknesses."
Respondent,00:03:34,"Okay. Obviously, strength is that everyone could eat, and if they have allergies, then they could eat at the sushi place. And, downside is probably that the guys eating or wanting to eat sushi could not eat sushi now, but that doesn't really matter, I suppose. At least in this case of the alternative. Oh. That I feel like I'm kind of missing the question. But, yeah, I guess that's my."
Interviewer,00:04:11,Your alternative decision is going to Italian restaurant.
Respondent,00:04:16,"Yes. Basically, yeah"
Interviewer,00:04:17,"Which was the idea of three people. The strength of it was that everyone can eat something, because no one is allergic to Italian. So, the weaknesses of this approaches?"
Respondent,00:04:30,"Ah, weaknesses, right. I forgot them. Probably that seven out of ten people do not get what they would fancy, but it's, there's no but, that would be the downside. Yes. Okay."
Interviewer,00:04:44,"All right. Let's talk a bit about politics. On a scale from 1 to 7. How interested are you in politics? One is not interested at all. Understand? Seven is the very interested."
Respondent,00:05:01,"Like a three."
Interviewer,00:05:05,"Okay. So, you said a three out of seven. Can you elaborate and explain your level of interest in politics?"
Respondent,00:05:19,"I'm interested in what's happening currently in politics because it determines a lot of what's happening in general, like around the whole world. But, it limits to the 15 minutes of targeted show that I listen to daily. But other than that, I'm not really a political. Maybe. The one exception is that I went to the AFD demo in Munich, but that's pretty much it."
Interviewer,00:05:45,So you are spending at least your 15 minutes daily for politics to follow the news. Yeah. Okay. And what do you think politics is? How would you define this term?
Respondent,00:06:01,"Probably the solution to the problem of living together to craft the rules that society needs to be well functional, and thereby required for this society to prevail."
Interviewer,00:06:18,"Okay. So you mentioned something about functionality or the public goods. And think back to the last time you took part in action that you considered political, the small or significant things. And if you are comfortable sharing, what was the most recent political activity you participated in?"
Respondent,00:06:41,"That would be the AFD demo I suppose, but also the increasing political talks I have with my friends."
Interviewer,00:06:52,"So you participated in a public meeting and also talking with your friends,is an usual thing for you. Consider a scenario where a seven year old boy decides to stop eating meat after watching a documentary on meat production, but his mother insists that he should continue to eat meat. Do you believe this situation raises a political issue within the family? Are they discussing politics?"
Respondent,00:07:20,"Okay. If I previously defined politics for me in a sense that it's required for society to work, I wouldn't consider it a political argument in the family because I think it's more of a family argument. Mother is requiring something from her son. But I think in general, the discussion about, veganism or vegetarianism is quite political. But within the family, I wouldn't consider it a political discussion."
Interviewer,00:07:52,"Okay, so you don't think that it's really the political discussion within the family. But vegetarianism as a political act is a general term. Can you think back and tell us about an instance that politics maybe made you feel very disappointed or very satisfied?"
Respondent,00:08:18,"Hmhm do you or can you see what's referred to by politics, like a political act or. Can you see that? Or is it just same political?"
Interviewer,00:08:31,"What's the question? Okay. You can think about, explanation that you define for politics and think politics as this explanation."
Respondent,00:08:43,"Okay."
Interviewer,00:08:43,"And then maybe, elaborate, sometimes value, disappointed and satisfied."
Respondent,00:08:51,"Okay. So I think the first thing that comes to mind is the speed at which politics acts and also the short. Short terms they act upon. I'm frequently unsatisfied with the decisions made. To be reelected, for example, investing money into education is a pretty long term investment. But wouldn't necessarily yield to a four year surplus. And what I mean is you're being reelected after four years in Germany, right? And therefore you will try to have some outcome you could show after four years. And I think, therefore the decisions that made are only short term. And this is why I'm usually quite disappointed in politics. I'm not sure if this is politics, or at least my definition of what we're not. I guess then it has no place in the answer. But just because I started it, I would mention it, the shift to the right, but the shift to the right. And this is it, you know, not not necessarily in politics. So I'm sorry for the mentioning that I guess."
Interviewer,00:10:09,"Okay, so this is a disappointment that you saw recently, but do you have any satisfaction?"
Respondent,00:10:24,"I think that the decisions made lately are going into a more liberal direction and a more scientific one, which is nice. But this is a broad statement. I couldn't really specify it."
Interviewer,00:10:51,"You said, shift to the right and also the short political decisions instead of long term ones are the downsides and mentioned the scientific attendance recently. Now that we have talked a little bit about the meaning of politics. Would you reconsider your definition of politics?"
Respondent,00:11:21,"No."
Interviewer,00:11:24,"You wouldn't? Okay. Let us talk about democracy. When you think about how democracy works now in Western countries such as Germany. What are the good things that come to mind?"
Respondent,00:11:45,"That everybody has a chance to speak up, that everybody has the chance of being heard. That everybody can participate in politics. This is a pretty general aspect of democracy, I think. Not necessarily of democracy in Germany."
Interviewer,00:12:00,"So for you the freedom of speech and the ability of speaking is the most essential. And the good thing in Western democracies. What are the bad things that come to your mind about democracy in the West?"
Respondent,00:12:21,"I think democracy in general has a pretty long\...requires a long time to make decisions because you have to wait for everyone's opinion. And in situations, for example, with Covid, this can lead to very late responses to happenings or to events, and that's not necessarily good. This would be different in an autocratic state. Basically, fast reactions to events. It's a downside of democracy and also of being reelected. What I already mentioned the four year term. Kinda, inhibit the potential upsides of investments that are long term investments. I'm not sure if that makes sense. Yeah. Okay."
Interviewer,00:13:20,"I don't know if I need to summarize everything. Okay, I'll go to the next one. Generally speaking, what makes a country democratic in your view? What are the most important elements of a democracy?"
Respondent,00:13:48,"Okay. What is the most important elements and what makes country democratic, right? I think what makes a country democratic is if everyone can take part in what's happening in politics and thereby what's happening in the rule building of the society. That's what makes democracy democratic to me. But the most important part for me is the freedom of speech, because that is basically the groundstone of. So you have to be able to speak your opinion, to be able to take part in everything. You cannot prohibit the freedom of speech, which would hinder the whole democratic, whole aspect of democracy."
Interviewer,00:14:39,"Yeah. Stepstone. You explained everything I would say. It's the most important. Yes."
Respondent,00:14:47,"Yeah. Thank you for that."
Interviewer,00:14:48,"Thank you. Can you elaborate on the first thing that you mentioned? Before the freedom of speech."
Respondent,00:14:59,"The what makes democracy democracy to me? Which everyone is able to take part in politics. Elaborate on that? Okay. If democracy is a form of of finding the rules that society lives by. Then, it's a way of finding the rules. Then what makes democracy a democracy is that everyone takes part in finding that rules and that\... Maybe elaborating comparing this to autocratic systems where only, for example, there is one leader deciding what is good or bad or maybe not necessarily good or bad, but just making the rules versus everyone has a part in making the rules. This is the."
Interviewer,00:15:50,"So it's actually general ability of participation?"
Respondent,00:15:53,"Yeah, yeah."
Interviewer,00:15:54,"Compared to autocracy. Okay. So, the final question is the architect of Munich's park for the 72 Olympics aim to create a democratic landscape that is open and accessible to all. But in what way do you think that public parks do or do not contribute to the principle of democracy or in a society?"
Respondent,00:16:18,"Public parks, public parks? How do they contribute to democracy basically, right? I understood that correctly?"
Interviewer,00:16:29,"Yeah. If you want, I can say it again. In what way do you think public parks do or do not contribute to the principle of democracy in society?"
Respondent,00:16:43,"I think that democracy requires to build your own opinion, to be able to give your own opinion in the rule building part, and therefore you would have to share your opinion or discuss about your opinion. Because democracy lives from conversation and public parks, or in general public places, allow people together to talk about their opinions, to share opinions, to discuss opinions, and therefore for a public parks. At least used to be or used to be more relevant for that. But like as a place to share this opinion, discuss your opinion. I guess it is the central part of democracy, probably. But this is more this is not necessarily the public park, but in general, a space where you can discuss publicly. By now, I suppose it's rather the internet and therefore public parks don't really have the same meaning, which they used to have. I'm not sure if they ever were used for discussing, but yeah."
Interviewer,00:17:44,"So maybe for 74 Olympics Olympia Park was a good place for discussions. I don't know."
Respondent,00:17:51,"Probably, but I remember that, you realized in Olympia Park there had Turkey missing on the card, right on the map."
Interviewer,00:18:02,"Yes. Yeah, I think so. But it's also a speech, so."
Respondent,00:18:06,"Okay."
Interviewer,00:18:07,"I try to respect it."
Interviewer,00:18:09,"That's all. Okay."
Respondent,00:18:15,"Nice."
