Interviewer,00:00:01,"okay. Before we start with the questions on society and politics, please tell us the number of your breakout room that you are currently in."
Respondent,00:00:10,"We are in room number one."
Interviewer,00:00:12,"Okay. Let's start. Please note that there are no right or wrong answers. We are just interested in your views. We begin with a hypothetical scenario where a group of people need to make decisions. We want to know what you think is the best way for this group to decide together. It's important to know that we're interested in the decision making process itself, not in what the final decision should be. So the scenario is imagine a group of ten people are deciding where to have a dinner event. Seven people want to have the event at a Japanese sushi restaurant, and three people cannot eat sushi because they have fish allergies, and they want to have the event at an Italian restaurant instead. They have to discuss this issue for a while, but have not come to a conclusion. How do you think, the group should decide on what to do?"
Respondent,00:01:12,"The group should, take into consideration all the restraints that some people in the group have. If the ultimate goal of these ten people is to go to a restaurant together, they should find a restaurant where every one of these people can eat. So, in my opinion, they should clearly probably look at the menu and see if they can find some food in the sushi restaurant without fish. Or if not, then the other people need to respect minority here and help them with their problems and choose a different restaurant, even though they would prefer that."
Interviewer,00:02:09,"Okay. Can you also think of other ways to make decisions apart from the method you just described?"
Respondent,00:02:18,"Sure. Another easy decision will be just to vote. And then the majority decides where they want to go."
Interviewer,00:02:29,"And what do you think would be a strength and a weakness of this alternative approach that you just said?"
Respondent,00:02:39,"Well, compared to the easier method of just voting, a strength of my first described methods would be that there would not be any people left behind who possibly could not participate in this evening."
Interviewer,00:02:58,"And what could be a weakness?"
Respondent,00:03:00,"A weakness is that a majority of people might be slightly inconvenienced."
Interviewer,00:03:06,"Okay. And now we're going to talk a little bit about politics. On a scale from one \-- not interested at all \-- to seven. that is very interested. How interested are you in politics?"
Respondent,00:03:22,"About a 5 or 6."
Interviewer,00:03:25,"Okay. And can you elaborate and explain why your level of interest is a six in politics?"
Respondent,00:03:33,"Well, I think. So politics is the very broad term is of course like affects your life. Decisions that are made and politics can majorly influence your whole life. So, of course, it makes sense to have a certain interest in politics and how your country is governed. But I think it's also important to not be too invested in politics and not let that take up your whole life, because in the end, you cannot influence it to a very high degree. So I think for your own good, it's best to not overdo your interests in politics."
Interviewer,00:04:30,"So you already, kind of, said what politics is to you. How would you further describe this term?"
Respondent,00:04:42,"Yeah. It's a very vague term for me at this time to give straight definition. But of course, politics includes how your country is governed. Different? Yeah, I think I'll just leave it like that."
Interviewer,00:05:03,"Okay. So now think back to the last time you took part in an action that you considered political, whether it was a small or significant, act. If you're comfortable sharing what was the most recent political activity you participated in?"
Respondent,00:05:23,"Oh. Funny thing, because I don't think I really actively participate in many things that could be considered political. I mean, I guess, but let us take that question again. Took part in an action because of political, I guess, voting. Yeah. Sort of political."
Interviewer,00:05:52,"Yes."
Respondent,00:05:52,"So actually that's, that's the exact time it was, but obviously the last time I was allowed to vote on some kind of election."
Interviewer,00:06:00,"Okay. Yeah. Now we have a scenario again. So, consider a seven year old boy that decides to stop eating meat after watching a documentary on meat production, but his mother insists that he should continue to eat meat. Do you believe this situation raises a political issue within the family, and do you think they are discussing politics?"
Respondent,00:06:29,"I think with a seven year old boy, you can only discuss politics at a very rudimentary level, at such a young age. But I think meat consumption can be a political issue. That doesn't necessarily need to be. I think at our current situation, it probably is a political issue, but it is not inherently so. I think generally the consumption of meat can just be an ethical issue theoretically, without being a political one."
Interviewer,00:07:08,"Okay, let's move on with the next question. Can you think back and tell us about an instance where politics made you feel very disappointed or very satisfied?"
Respondent,00:07:22,"Sure. Looking at any election results often makes me very disappointed."
Interviewer,00:07:28,"Okay."
Respondent,00:07:29,"When I see all of the election polls for the next election, when I see the poll numbers, for example. So, the very right-wing parties, this can very disappointing."
Interviewer,00:07:45,"Okay, so yet you said one thing that made you disappointed. Is there, one thing that maybe, made you satisfied?"
Respondent,00:07:57,"Sure. I mean, seven years, I guess stuff like raising minimum wage is something that generally is a satisfying political outcome to me."
Interviewer,00:08:15,"Now that we have talked a little bit about the meaning of politics, would you reconsider your definition of politics that you said before?"
Respondent,00:08:26,"Yes, because I was very shaky at my definition in the beginning already, and I still don't have a perfect definition now, so I was unsure about the definition back then, and I still am at this point."
Interviewer,00:08:40,"Okay. Yeah. And now let's, talk about democracy. When you think about how democracy works right now in Western countries such as Germany, what are the good things that come to mind?"
Respondent,00:08:59,"The good things that come to mind is that generally, it seems that Germany still is a democratic country. It's free to live relatively free life and not the\... Hard question. Good things about democracy. Just."
Interviewer,00:09:54,"Okay\..."
Respondent,00:09:54,"Yeah. Yeah, sure. Skip to the next question."
Interviewer,00:09:59,"Okay. We can do that. And what are the bad things that come to your mind about democracy in the West?"
Respondent,00:10:09,"I think the way democracy is implemented here might have some flaws because often people are elected but that does not mean that they necessarily need to actually fulfill any promises they made while campaigning, or actually do whatever the people who elected them want them to do. So, I think elected politicians sometimes don't necessarily represent best what people would want them to do."
Interviewer,00:11:03,"Okay. And generally speaking what makes a country democratic?"
Respondent,00:11:13,"Free and fair elections. I want to say. That's like the main point."
Interviewer,00:11:22,"Okay. And what are the most important elements of a democracy?"
Respondent,00:11:31,"Democracy. The most important elements of a democracy. I mean, I guess it's still not the same as before. The most important elements are that people can vote for whoever they want. I guess within reason. Voting for undemocratic parties who want to actively destroy democracy. I think it could be considered democratic to forbid those. Okay. Yeah. I think democracy for me is mainly about electing people to lead the country."
Interviewer,00:12:18,"Okay. And the last question, the architect of Munich's Olympia Park for the 1972 Olympics aim to create a democratic landscape that is open and accessible to all. In what way do you think public parks do or do not contribute to the principles of democracy and society?"
Respondent,00:12:43,"I mean, generally the idea of a democracy would be that everyone has the same kind of vote and influence and can participate in the same way. And so designed and you're part that is very accessible and where everyone can enter freely and participate, so to say, if they want to. I mean, it's just, it represents or it represents the values of democracy maybe. But I think even if not parks, all parks are inclusive are the consist of a democratic country. So it's not the most important thing, I think."
Interviewer,00:13:38,"Okay. Thank you."
