Interviewer,00:00:04,"Before we start with the questions on society and politics, please tell us the number of your breakout room that you are currently in."
Respondent,00:00:11,"I am in a breakout room two."
Interviewer,00:00:14,"Okay, thanks. Perfect. Let's start. Please note that there are no right or wrong answers. We are just interested in your views. We begin with a hypothetical scenario with where a group of people need to make decisions. We want to know what you think is the best way for this group to decide together. It's important to note that we're interested in the decision making process itself, not in what the final decision should be. Okay, imagine a group of ten people, are deciding where to have dinner event. Seven people want to have the event at a Japanese sushi restaurant. Three people cannot eat sushi because they have fish allergies. And they want to have the event at an Italian restaurant instead. They have discussed this issue but have not come to a conclusion. How should the group decide what to do?"
Respondent,00:01:06,"I think the first thing you might think is like, there are seven people I want to that want to go to the sushi restaurant, but only three to the Italian one. So maybe they should go to the sushi restaurant. But considering that three people have, like, allergies, they might be prior prioritized, over the other seven. So they might end up in the Italian restaurant because, yeah, that would be a suitable solution for everyone. Even though, yeah, seven people might not like it. Like, if they have allergies, maybe then that's another discussion. But yeah, I think that would be in general better for the whole group."
Interviewer,00:01:48,"Okay. Interesting. All right. Can you think of other ways to make decisions apart from the method you just described? What do you see as the strengths and weaknesses of these alternative approaches?"
Respondent,00:02:02,"Well, I think if they really can form an opinion that everyone is happy with, they just like split up the group and like one party goes to the one restaurant and the other to the other restaurant. But I think if they want to have it as a group event, that well wouldn't be a group event anymore, because not all ten people, or maybe then they can find a compromise and go to, I don't know, some other restaurant or a Mexican restaurant, and everyone is happy with that, I don't know."
Interviewer,00:02:37,"Okay. Perfect. I think you also talked about strengths and weaknesses of these approaches. Then we'll cover the next question. Yeah. Let's talk a bit about politics. On a scale from one, means not interested at all, to seven is very interested. How interested are you in politics?"
Respondent,00:03:02,"I would probably like 2 or 3. Not that interested."
Interviewer,00:03:06,"Okay. If you would need to decide for one number, is it more 2 or 3?"
Respondent,00:03:13,"Probably three."
Interviewer,00:03:15,"Okay, perfect. And can you elaborate and explain your level of interests in politics?"
Respondent,00:03:22,"I think, there always is a baseline interest because politics involves, like, my life. Kind of like I in the country, and they have politics. So, should always be a little bit of baseline interest like, what are the decisions and, like, going to, to vote or something, but, you know, for me, this, this interest doesn't go over this baseline. I just I'm not, yeah. Not too interested in all the details of politics."
Interviewer,00:04:01,"Okay, maybe a bit of a further questions to that. Why do you think that interest is not that deep in politics?"
Respondent,00:04:16,"Well, I think there's a lot of discussions, like it takes a long while till there are some decisions. So to be really interested in politics, like I'm not interested in all those discussions and like, there's over obviously like the law that is always a part of. Yeah. Of politics. Yeah. It's it's just too much, too much for me, but I'm not really interested to go too deep into it."
Interviewer,00:04:48,"Okay. Fine. Yeah. Yeah. And what do you think politics is? How would you define this term? I mean, you already talked about a bit bit about it, but maybe we could go more deep in it. And you try to define this term and say what you think politics is."
Respondent,00:05:09,"I think when you think of politics, you think of like the organization of a country and the organization of its population and trying to, yeah, make decisions for this population. Yeah. Trying to find the best decision."
Interviewer,00:05:29,"Okay. Do you think there's anything else for for defining politics or such, apart from what you just described?"
Respondent,00:05:41,"Yeah, I think it's a a lot of. Yeah. Discussing and finding decisions. Yeah."
Interviewer,00:05:46,"Okay. Yeah. Then we'll go to the next question. Yeah. Think back to the last time you took part in an action that you considered political. Whether it was a small or significant act. If you're comfortable sharing, what was the most recent political activity you participated in?"
Respondent,00:06:08,"I'm going to be honest. I'm not really participating in a lot of political activities, so it probably would be to vote."
Interviewer,00:06:17,"Okay. But. Yeah. Good. Yeah."
Respondent,00:06:23,"I can't really think of anything political."
Interviewer,00:06:26,"Yeah. That sounded a bit unsure about voting, but would you say voting is something political?"
Respondent,00:06:35,"Yeah, definitely. So, and that's the baseline of like our politics I would say."
Interviewer,00:06:42,"Okay."
Respondent,00:06:43,"So you have the right to vote"
Interviewer,00:06:45,"Yeah. All right. Then you say the last one was the, your last political action was voting. Okay. Then now consider a scenario where a seven year old boy decides to stop eating meat after watching a documentary on meat production, but his mother insists that he should continue to eat meat. Do you believe the situation raises a political issue within the family, and are they discussing politics?"
Respondent,00:07:17,"Well, if it's just I think as politics, as something more larger scale. Probably not. But, yeah, there are probably different kinds of politics, like family politics. And that would probably be a very like family political discussion."
Interviewer,00:07:38,"Okay. And do you think they're really discussing politics at the end of the day?"
Respondent,00:07:46,"Well, it's always difficult when there's like a child because the mother always has the\... They're not on the same level, like the mother always has the upper ground. So they are definitely discussing something. But I think maybe politics also means discussing something on a high level. That's not the case. So yeah, probably not the political but the kind of political and family politics. But yeah."
Interviewer,00:08:16,"Yeah, more family politics. Okay. All right. Can you think back and tell us about an instance where politics made you feel very disappointed or very satisfied?"
Respondent,00:08:31,"I think where I'm disappointed is when I'm looking at, like, the news right now and, like, see how much the, like, the extreme right party things and popularity. And I don't really think that, that the voters actually know maybe all the time with the voting for which just like, protest voters. I'm unhappy, so I'm gonna go extreme. And I think that's pretty dumb. That's kind of disappointing. But in general, when I, when I compare our Germany country's politics to different kind of politics, I'm, like, always glad that I'm here and not in countries with different politics."
Interviewer,00:09:18,"All right. Okay. Yeah. And now that we have talked a little bit about the meaning of politics, would you reconsider your definition of politics?"
Respondent,00:09:28,"I think I thought of politics always very like narrow that, like the country politics. But I guess the more kind of politics, like family politics, unlike in other organizations. So, yeah, I think I would include that in a definition."
Interviewer,00:09:46,"Okay. So you would say you just, broadened your or it just like, I don't know, how to tell or how to state it, but you just, yeah, add some things to the meaning of politics because it's more than you thought before."
Respondent,00:10:04,"Oh, yeah. Yeah, probably."
Interviewer,00:10:06,"Okay. Interesting. Now, let let us talk about democracy. When you think about how democracy works right now in Western countries such as Germany, what are the good things that come to mind?"
Respondent,00:10:19,"I think the most obvious one is that everyone has the right to, voice their opinion. And, they don't have to be scared about their opinion, but every opinion matters. Yeah, I think that's that's it."
Interviewer,00:10:36,"Okay. So something more you think democracy can do to a country?"
Respondent,00:10:44,"I think when you're looking at negatives, maybe that's what I like briefly mentioned before that people who like people can influence a lot, but also influence in the negative. And when they're not that informed or not that. Yeah. Interested or just want to protest against something that could lead to a dangerous scenario."
Interviewer,00:11:10,"Okay. Yeah. And maybe this comes a bit to the next questions, about bad things that come to your mind about democracy in the West. You covered it a bit, but maybe we can talk a bit more about it."
Respondent,00:11:21,"Yeah. Now, I would argue it's, it can be dangerous for people who are uneducated. But I think, like, in general, like, mass intelligence kind of, normally weighs that a little bit out, but not always, as we can see now with the voting, results or predictions. Yeah. I don't know how to what to say more about that."
Interviewer,00:11:53,"Yeah it's fine. Yeah I understand your point. Yeah. But more generally, what makes a country democratic? In your view, what are the most important elements of a democracy?"
Respondent,00:12:09,"Well, I think there's not. But there are. There isn't one person that has, more power than the others, obviously, like politicians to have more influence. Also a little bit more power. But there isn't a person who can say, okay, this, yeah, this law, I want it to be done and everyone has to follow it. So like, there is always like, power balance and different things, so nobody can. Yeah, totally run the country over. Yeah. And everyone like, even doesn't it doesn't matter who you are, but everyone has the right to be part of the discussions and the decisions."
Interviewer,00:12:54,"Can you give maybe you're an example for for a really democratic, yeah. Really democratic thing."
Respondent,00:13:06,"Yeah. Maybe, I don't know, how t's called in English but have like the, the veto right. So the people can go like, sign, stuff to say, no, we don't want that long, we don't want this and that. And the politicians have to actually, acknowledge that and maybe act on it. So. Yeah, I think that's pretty democratic."
Interviewer,00:13:31,"Okay. Yeah. Cool. Nice example. Yeah. Okay. Now, we come to the last question, the architect of Munich's Olympic Park, after Munich's Olympic Park for the 1972 Olympics, aimed to create a democratic landscape that is open and accessible to all. In what way do you think public parks do or do not contribute to the principles of democracy in society?"
Respondent,00:13:59,"Can you repeat that?"
Interviewer,00:14:00,"Yeah, of course."
Respondent,00:14:01,"I'm not sure if I can."
Interviewer,00:14:02,"So, the architect of the Olympia Park in Munich aimed to create a democratic landscape, which is open and accessible to all. And in what way do you think now can public parks contribute to the principles of democracy in society?"
Respondent,00:14:23,"Okay. Well. So I got it right that, like parks, like, with greenery and stuff?"
Interviewer,00:14:32,"Yeah, exactly."
Respondent,00:14:33,"Yeah. Okay. Because making it accessible, I think, is a pretty big step for making accessible for everyone. Like, also, people who need to use a wheelchair or, I don't know, and generally, creating a safe environment like that's probably a big, a big, it is difficult, because we like the. Yeah, they don't always have influence, like politicians don't have influence on that, but, maybe have some security there so everyone feels welcome and safe."
Interviewer,00:15:15,"Yeah. Yeah. Maybe one one further questions to that. Do you think the Olympia Park is such a park?"
Respondent,00:15:25,"I'm going to be honest, I don't. I'm not often in Olimpia Park andI'm not sure. Oh, it's actually looks good. Yeah. Yeah, I can't answer that question."
Interviewer,00:15:36,"That's fine. I mean, you know, it's huge city and you can't be in there in public every day."
Interviewer,00:15:44,"But, yeah, that was the last question. Thanks a lot. I've learned a lot. I hope you too."
Respondent,00:15:50,"Yeah."
